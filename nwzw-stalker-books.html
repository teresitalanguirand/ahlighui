Given how much of a pain it can be to get Russian books back in the US I’m planning on bringing home quite a few. I’m interested in getting books from the Stalker and Metro series, but I’m not sure which ones are considered good. Any recommendations? Thanks.

About two years ago, for school, I translated a section of one of the STALKER books (keep in mind there's 40-50, if not more), from my native Russian, to my now native English (i've lived in America for 8 years now). And since then, little by little, I've been translating the rest of the book. I have even gone as far as contacting the author, Alexander Zorich, for permission to publish my translation once it's done. I received that permission along with a "good.

So a while back I promised to post a sample of my translation, but I haven't been able to, seeing as I wasn't home. Now that I'm back in America, I'll live up to my promise.

Stalker (Russian: Машина желаний, lit. "The Wish Machine") is a novel by Boris and Arkady Strugatsky based on an early draft screenplay for the movie Stalker. Ok this is a really dumb situation but I really just want some random opinions on this before I do something potentially horrendous. My friend, Anna, had her baby two months ago and she's having a sort of belated baby shower because she was really sick during her pregnancy and never got around to it. I am friendly with Anna because we were part of the same sorority in college, but it's also more of a friend-of-a-friend situation. My closest friends are close with her, whereas I knew Anna becau. do they have enough cheeki breeki. I'm looking for the most comprehensive book on the subject, so probably something more recent, if possible. I've watched some videos about it but, they all leave out so much. Thanks I couldn't find any Stalker books to order. And if I found one it was in German. Any suggestions where i can order some books. Before its suggested I've read roadside picnic and watched andrei tarkovsky's stalker, and loved both, and after playing the games and exhausting all other media i'm obsessed again, does anyone know any books, movies, or other games with similarities to roadside picnic and both the stalker games and movie? i especially love the concepts of anomalies and exclusion zone areas and the eastern european aesthetic from all 3 Edit: I haven't read the official stalker books Need some help here, there was a Stalker book right? Is it good? Where I know a topic like this was probably mentioned on this subreddit, but i couldn't find it. I have a question guys, can u recommend any literature that is similar to Stalker (ofc, except for stalker books themselves). This will come up quite a lot in the near future, as word about the miniseries spreads, so maybe now is a good time that this should be addressed? ampnbsp; There are currently 3 subreddits around (excluding the specialized Stalker book/film/game ones) pertaining to the Chernobyl disaster: 1. r/chernobyl 2. r/ChernobylTV 3. r/TVChernobyl ampnbsp; r/chernobyl will continue to be the serious one that addresses the actuality of the disaster as well as any non-fictional (biographies, docume. 
I loved the books. Loved the series. I don't know why I like stalker books so much. But here we are. Does anyone have any recommendations. I have a really good one here. Before I begin I should inform you that for whatever reason our school has something the students like to call a stalker book. Containing the names addresses and phone numbers of the parents of the child. B=Bully BM= Bully's mom D= My dad Me = Me This story all begins at the beginning of 8th grade we had just been told where to sit because the teacher was strict so no free seating. I was sat next to a kid named B who was a total ass. I was a grade ahead because. I was in my junior year of high school back in 2007 , my parents were Air Force so I moved schools a lot, in a lot of cases these stories are about shy nerdy girls, well I was a shy nerdy guy, and I’m going to be honest from the perspective of others I may too have been a neck beard, but I definitely know I wasn’t worse than well call this neck beard James. James was in my 4th period biology class we sat next to each other because the teachers gave us assigned seats at the beginning of the semes. \ From "Void Stalker", book three of the Night Lords trilogy\ 'I am Tolemion of the Genesis, Warden of the West Protectorate. I am the End of Heretics, the Bane of Traitors, and a loyal son of Guilliman.' 'oh,' Xarl chucked through his voxspeaker. 'You must be very proud.' He tossed something round and heavy onto the decking between them both. It rolled to knock gently against Tolemion's boot. A helm. A Genesis Space Marine's helm - the eye lenses put out, the faceplate smeared with blood. 
I love watching these type of movies. I was wondering if there are any books out there that are as thrilling as the movies.
