                            <p> Long post but worth it. TLDR at the end. Well, since HGC is sadly in the past now, it's time for us to remember the best of our pro scene. Because in their farewell posts some pro teams claimed to be "the second best team" in HGC history, and because I have my own opinion on the matter, I thought this would be a good instance to debate about it as a community, but I want to expand the topic to the history of the pro scene as a whole. So, no more shit, here are my thoughts and you're welcome. 
The upcoming demise of Blessed Gardens does not portend well for the game as a whole. How‚Äôs that for an opener? It seems melodramatic, but if you look over all the new modes that FEH has added over its lifespan, you‚Äôll see a troubling pattern that bogs down the game. While not all of them have been quite as troubled as Blessed Gardens‚Äô existence, it still points to one of the long running problems that many of the game‚Äôs modes struggle with: what does it ultimately Aside from a few criticisms which I'll mention later, I think this mode is pretty well-thought-out and fun. First of all, while I'm not thrilled that your team's base score is determined in the same way as Arena, this mode does provide a few ways of getting around that and including a hero or two you might like that isn't a high-scorer. Paired-up heroes don't seem to count toward your base score. That means that you can sneak in a ranged hero as your Legendary hero's pair-up partner without. We now have a new tactic to employ in battles: Pair Up! This effect allowing heroes to share the same space and swap on demand is Legendary Roy's legendary effect, and it will be an effect for legendary heroes going forward. Pair Up can be used in: Main Story Paralogues Training Tower Allegiance Battles Pair up is utilized in the new mode: Allegiance Battles , where two heroes can be paired without either needing to be a legendary hero. Allegiance Battles scores the same way as Arena In this Idle Heroes: Arena Battle Breakdown (https://playidlegames.com/idle-heroes-arena/) game, one has to choose a character for playing amp don‚Äôt worry about the looks as they all represent some sort of ancient mystic gods. Then by choosing a character, one will be registered there with a username which is chosen by the user then there is mainly three arenas in the game in which the user has to fight the opponent. One has to face three opponents in an arena the first two opponents What are the specific criteria to have in a battle for an increase in ladder points. Facebook only event.

Alright, spoiler concerning the game Roccat vs G2 in Heroes Battle Arena ahead, so dont read further if you dont want to be spoiled. Roccat was having a lead during the second game and G2 went toward the middle keep after they got beaten during the shrine fight where no hero died (post lvl 20). I expected them to take the damaged keep and retreat (probably so did Roccat). But instead they went for the core. Now, so far, so Backdoor. Yet Roccat reacted immediately, they got all 5 heroes https://imgur.com/gallery/H21FNlN (https://imgur.com/gallery/H21FNlN) i recently got a few more good heroes and i dont know which to use. I only have five hero bases unfortunately i am working on the sixth right now. Thanks for any comments. Hi , im new in the game i beginning on my server 6 days ago and i have a dude about trials of the champion as a noob player . Can i complete this event in the course of the month? or i can not? If you could give me information about this event, I would greatly appreciate it since I am new to the game and I want to learn and get the most rewards 
Hey everyone. Decided to create this guide for beginners becasue its really annoying see countless threads about same questions like who to farm, where to farm and spend gold/energy and why etc. So i hope this guide is useful and if you have questions about the game - its covered here (or in comments). Update history: 25.01.2019 - added and edited some info. 02.02.2019 - added and edited info about mid game and Succubus farm amp#x200B; Usefull links: aomdb.com (https://aomdb.com). </p>
