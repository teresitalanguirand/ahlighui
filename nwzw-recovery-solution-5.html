She has to make 9 monthly payments and then will be in good standing. For several years, I have been fighting an 85$ debt collection that routinely drops my credit (-92 points today!). I have disputed it in the past and it's been "taken care of" but then it shows up again! I have never received written notice or a phone call. The company shows up as DEBT RECOVERY SOLUTIONS on my credit report. What can I do to contact them or dispute the claim/stop this from happening every year? I have no idea where to turn.

I have a debt that was accrued as a result of a failed marriage years ago. My ex wife was on my medical at the time and she refused to pay it after the divorce. (There was no clause stating she had to pay it though.) I just got a letter in the mail regarding it, and it’s not on my credit report. At the very bottom, it states “The law limits how long you can be sued for a debt. Because of the age of your debt, Pendrick capital partners and dynamic recovery solutions cannot sue for it and Pendrick. Hello Reddit. Dynamic Recovery Solutions just mailed me that I owe about 0 with an healthcare related debt (which looks bogus, never been to the hospital before). and it includes an Original Creditor name as the hospital, an Original Account Number, a DRS Reference Number, the Current Creditor, Current Creditor Reference Number, and my balance.

I have been recently diagnosed with a double lumbar hernia (L4-L5, L5-S1) with fragmentation (from what I can understand it's a splinter from the L5 disc). The diagnostic comes from an MRI a couple weeks ago. During my last visit to the doctor I was referred to a neurosurgeon (which I am seeing today) for further investigations (The splinter, combined with the hernias made my doctor uncomfortable in recommending a treatment plan past medication to manage the pain).
