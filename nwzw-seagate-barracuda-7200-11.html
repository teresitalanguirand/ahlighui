I have a drive with a siezed spindle (it fell 50cm-ish). I opened it up, hoping it was a stuck head, but no luck. The bearing is completely stuck. The heads can move, but I was not able to rotate the spindle a single degree. I'm very carefull and I've fixed a few hard drives successfully before (head stick mainly), but this one is above my skillset. If I send it to professionals, what would they do exactly, and what (roughly) would be the chances for success?

How do I make the drive work again? I don't care about what is on it but the disk won't show up in BIOS anymore because of a firmware failure. Is there any simple way to reactivate the drive?

My HDD was Acer OEM and came with an Aspire M5100. (Firmware: SD46) Two years ago, the drive bricked; I suspected that it was BSY. Two days ago, I've managed to repair it to get it out of the BSY state. However, it could easily die to the same problem again. Apparently, Seagate won't update firmware for OEM drives; I can't find any information from Acer either. Am I out of luck? Should I contact customer support?

So my Seagate Barracuda 7200.11 1,5TB died today and I bought a Crucial MX500 500GB SSD SATA 3. My mobo is Gigabyte EX58-UD5 so it's SATA 2 compatible. Do I just connect the cables to the SSD?

So a couple of weeks ago I posted about this problem here (https://www.reddit.com/r/FORTnITE/comments/9ukqru/crashes_mid_games/) and one user told me that I needed more ram. I agreed cause I only had 4gb at the time, but today I bought another 4gb (upgrading to 8gb total) and tried again. 10 minutes inside a mission and the game crashed again. idk what to do.

Identifying the Problem These are instructions for fixing a Seagate 7200.11 hard drive that is stuck in the BSY state. This can be determined by the fact that it won't be recognized by the computer's. I'm thinking about upgrading my HDD. Really can't decide. I know theres some differences with performance but I doubt I'll notice the difference in real life. Real question I think is is Black worth another 100$ in price for a 5 yr warrenty vs a 2 yr. I like their confidence but I feel like the drive will be outdated by then. BTW this system will be an SSD OS Boot system with this Hard drive used as storage if that makes a difference. –ñ–µ—Å—Ç–∫–∏–π –¥–∏—Å–∫ ‚Äî —ç—Ç–æ –æ–¥–Ω–∞ –∏–∑ —Å–∞–º—ã—Ö –Ω–µ–Ω–∞–¥–µ–∂–Ω—ã—Ö –≤–µ—â–µ–π –≤ –∫–æ–º–ø—å—é—Ç–µ—Ä–µ. –ò –æ–¥–Ω–æ–≤—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–Ω–æ –æ–Ω–∞ —Å–∞–º–∞—è —Ü–µ–Ω–Ω–∞—è. –ù–∞ –Ω–µ–π –º–æ–∂–µ—Ç —Ö—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—Ç—å—Å—è –∫—Ä–∞–π–Ω–µ –≤–∞–∂–Ω–∞—è –∏–Ω—Ñ–æ—Ä–º–∞—Ü–∏—è, —Å—Ç–æ–∏–º–æ—Å—Ç—å.

I've seen frame drops to 30-40ish in big teamfights in overwatch and setting everything to low and renderscale to 50% didn't fix the issue.

Hi Everyone, I have a PC I built in 2008 (wow thats old!!!) that still runs and I am looking to upgrade it. I have already upgraded it once a few years ago - upgrading the RAM and GPU. Unfortunately the only things I think I can save from my old rig are the box, GPU, and PSU. This leaves me replacing the CPU, MOBO, and RAM.
